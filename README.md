# Absenteeism_Prediction_in_Workplace
# Introduction
Absenteeism is the term given when an employee is habitually and frequently absent from work. This excludes paid leave and occasions where an employer has granted an employee time off.

This task will address Absenteeism at a company during work time.

Problem: Business environment nowadays is more competitive than it used to be. This lead to increased pressure in the workplace. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that unachievable business goals and an elevated risk of unemployment can raise people's stress levels. Often, the continuous presence of such factors becomes detrimental to a person's health. Sometimes this may result in minor illness which of course is not desired. However, it may happen that the employee develops a long-term condition. An example being depression.

# Looking at predicting absenteeism from work.
We would like to know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of hours in a given work day.
Having such information in advance can improve our decision-making. How? by re-organizing the work process in a way that will allow us to avoid a lack of productivity and increase the quality of work generated in our firm.

Logically here come some additional questions based on what information should we predict whether an employee is expected to be absent or not.
How would we measure absenteeism?
Should we rather think about trying to predict excessive absenteeism?
Just remember that as a whole the purpose of the business task will be to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.
In other words, we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work based on information such as how far they live from their workplace? How many children and pets they have? Do they have higher education? and so on.
